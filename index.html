Hello Class , my name is Deitmar. I am new in NC, Wake Forest area and three years in USA. 
I'm past forty , but being in a new country I think it is important I remake myself. 
Learning is an ongoing process so we should always embrace it. Never be afraid of new things, never be afraid to grow.
Learning a new skill is importamt, especially in a ever changing world. Where society keeps on evolving.
 So pay attention to your lecturers and put in effort in all you do. 

This leads us into why it is important to always show Academic Integrity. 
Academic integrity speaks to the type of character within a person. It also says a lot about a tutor. 
Is the lecture engaging, does it spark curiosity. And Plagiarism says no it's not. 
Copying the work of others suggests that you are not interested. It suggests that you are lazy. 
Copying work without highlighting the creator, may suggests that you are being devious. 
This may not be true and this is why we should doubble check our work, ensuring we are giving acknowledgment to our source of 
information and its creator. This will say to the lecturer , you may not be verbose but you did dig for the data. 
Also it will show that you respected the effort the creator did to put his findings out there. I
t will speak to zest for learning new things, it will motivate the lecturer. It;s a two way street.
